ðŸ“¦ Inventory Management System
âœ… Exercise Overview

This project is a simple Stock/Inventory Management System implemented in Java.
The goal is to practice using HashMap for fast product access via unique IDs, as well as to train object manipulation and method reuse.

ðŸ›  Classes
1. Product

Represents a product with the following attributes:

id (int) â†’ Unique identifier

name (String) â†’ Product name

quantity (int) â†’ Quantity in stock

price (double) â†’ Unit price

2. Inventory

Manages a collection of products stored in a HashMap (<Integer, Product>).

Methods:

addProduct(Product p) â†’ Adds a product if it doesnâ€™t already exist (putIfAbsent).

removeProduct(int id) â†’ Removes a product by its ID.

updateQuantity(int id, int quantity) â†’ Updates the stock quantity of a product.

findProductById(int id) â†’ Returns the product or a message if itâ€™s not found.

listAllProducts() â†’ Displays all registered products.

ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

Practice using HashMap for quick lookups.

Explore the use of putIfAbsent for controlled insertions.

Train object manipulation in Java.

Encourage logic reuse inside methods (like in a banking system exercise).
